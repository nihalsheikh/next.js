# NEXT.JS

Next.js is a flexible React Framework. <br>

- It is not just a Frontend Framework, but a Full Stack Framework. <br>

- `Framework` serves as a tool equipped with predefined rules and conventions that offer a structured approach to
constructing an application. <br>

- It provides an environment that outlines: <br>
    - Overall architectures <br>
    - Design patterns <br>
    - Workflows <br>

- This allows developers to focus on implementing specific
application logic rather than dealing with low-level design. <br>

- To put it more simply, a `framework` provides pre-built solutions for common functionalities such as: <br>
    - Integrating databases <br>
    - Managing routing <br>
    - Handling authentication <br>
    - etc... <br>

-  Next.js is like an extension of React.js <br>
    - incorporates pre-built solutions. <br>
    - Ready-to-use features <br>
    - Additional functionalities <br>

- Next.js is built on top of React. <br>
